Debugging Issues
****************

This section describes debugging techniques for issues encountered during the
simulation/analysis processes.

Using JADE
==========

Please refer to JADE documentation - https://nrel.github.io/jade/tutorial.html#debugging

Using PyDSS
===========

DISCO creates a PyDSS project directory for each simulation job. On successful
completion the directory will have the following contents:

* ``project.zip``
* ``store.h5``

If there was an error then the directory contents will be unzipped. Here is
example content:

.. code-block:: bash

  $ find output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project

  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/DSSfiles
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/DSSfiles/deployment.dss
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/Exports
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/Exports/deployment52.dss
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/Logs
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/Logs/pydss-project_deployment52.dss.log
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/PyDSS_Scenarios
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/PyDSS_Scenarios/deployment52.dss
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/PyDSS_Scenarios/deployment52.dss/ExportLists/exports.toml
  output/feeder_2__3__1.15__1.0__deployment52.dss/pydss-project/PyDSS_Scenarios/deployment52.dss/pyControllerList/controllers.toml

For the PyDSS logs, you can find in the following directory.

- ``<deployment_name>/logs/<deployment_name>_simulation.log``: Records all
  changes made to OpenDSS files as well as all PyDSS settings.
- ``<deployment_name>/pydss-project/Logs/pydss-project-<deployment_name>.log``:
  This log file is generated by PyDSS.
